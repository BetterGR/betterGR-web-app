# Yearly Project

## Course Overview

This is a comprehensive yearly project course where students apply their knowledge of software engineering 
principles to develop real-world applications. Students work in teams to design, implement, and deploy full-stack applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply software engineering principles in practice
- Work effectively in development teams
- Master full-stack development technologies
- Implement proper testing and deployment strategies
- Practice agile development methodologies

## Course Structure

### Phase 1: Planning & Design (Weeks 1-4)
- Project proposal and requirements analysis
- System architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Project planning and timeline creation

### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 5-12)
- Iterative development cycles
- Regular code reviews and team meetings
- Continuous integration and testing
- Progress presentations

### Phase 3: Deployment & Presentation (Weeks 13-14)
- Final system deployment
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- Project documentation
- Final presentations and demos

## Assessment

- **Project Proposal**: 15%
- **Interim Progress Reports**: 25%
- **Final Project**: 40%
- **Presentation**: 20%

## Technologies

Students typically work with modern web technologies including:
- Frontend: React, Vue.js, or Angular
- Backend: Node.js, Python, or Java
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar
- Deployment: Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Project Overview

The Yearly Project in Software Engineering is a comprehensive capstone project where students apply their knowledge to develop a real-world software solution. This project spans the entire academic year and involves all phases of software development lifecycle.

## Project Goals

- Apply software engineering principles to a substantial project
- Work collaboratively in a team environment
- Experience the complete software development lifecycle
- Develop professional presentation and documentation skills
- Create a portfolio-worthy software product

## Methodology

Students will follow an Agile development methodology with regular sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives. The project emphasizes:

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understanding stakeholder needs
2. **System Design** - Creating scalable and maintainable architecture
3. **Implementation** - Writing clean, tested, and documented code
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing at all levels
5. **Deployment** - CI/CD and production deployment strategies

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Project Selection | Weeks 1-2 | Team formation, project proposal |
| Requirements & Planning | Weeks 3-6 | Requirements gathering, project planning |
| Design & Architecture | Weeks 7-10 | System design, technology selection |
| Implementation Sprint 1 | Weeks 11-16 | Core functionality development |
| Implementation Sprint 2 | Weeks 17-22 | Feature completion, integration |
| Testing & Deployment | Weeks 23-26 | Testing, deployment, documentation |
| Final Presentation | Week 27 | Project demonstration and defense |

## Deliverables

1. **Project Proposal** - Initial project scope and requirements
2. **Design Document** - System architecture and design decisions
3. **Working Software** - Fully functional application
4. **Test Suite** - Comprehensive testing documentation
5. **Deployment Guide** - Instructions for deployment and maintenance
6. **Final Presentation** - Project demonstration and technical deep-dive

## Resources

- Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach by Roger Pressman
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
- The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
- Project management tools: Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects
- Version control: Git and GitHub/GitLab

## Team Structure

Teams of 4-6 students with rotating roles:
- **Project Manager** - Coordinates team activities and timelines
- **Lead Developer** - Oversees technical implementation
- **QA Engineer** - Responsible for testing and quality assurance
- **DevOps Engineer** - Handles deployment and infrastructure
- **UI/UX Designer** - Focuses on user experience and interface design
- **Technical Writer** - Manages documentation and communication
