# Assignment 1: Introduction to Programming Concepts

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will implement several basic programming concepts to demonstrate your understanding of variables, control structures, and functions.

## Tasks

### 1. Variables and Data Types (20 points)

Create variables of the following types:
- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- Array/List

Demonstrate operations appropriate for each type.
